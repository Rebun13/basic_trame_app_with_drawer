# basic_trame_app_with_drawer

Basic Trame + PyVista app that includes a file input to load local files and a drawer with basic options.

I had a hard time using Trame for the first time, so I hope this little example can be useful for someone.

It uses the "simple page with drawer layout", and the drawer contains a group of radio buttons and a select.

This example might be suboptimal, so any advice to improve it is welcome üòÅ
